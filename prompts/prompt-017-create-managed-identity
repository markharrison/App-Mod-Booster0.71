Create a user-assigned managed identity for the application to use when connecting to Azure SQL and other Azure services.

Name it something like mid-AppModAssist-[timestamp] where the timestamp makes it unique (e.g., including day, hour, and minute).

**Important:** The timestamp should be passed as a parameter to this module. The main.bicep should define the timestamp as a PARAMETER with a default value (not a variable):

    param timestamp string = utcNow('yyyyMMddHHmm')

This is because `utcNow()` can only be used as a parameter default value in Bicep, not in variable declarations. Using `var timestamp = utcNow(...)` will cause a BCP065 error.

This identity will be assigned to the App Service so it can authenticate to Azure SQL without storing any passwords or connection secrets.

Note: With user-assigned managed identities, the principalId isn't directly on the identity object - it's nested under properties. Be careful when trying to output this value in Bicep.

Save the Bicep file as `deploy-infra/modules/managed-identity.bicep` and ensure it can be called from `deploy-infra/main.bicep`.

The managed identity must be created early in the deployment process because both the App Service and SQL Server need to reference it.

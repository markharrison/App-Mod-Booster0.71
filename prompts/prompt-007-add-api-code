Create all the API endpoints needed to support the functionality shown in the screenshots. The application code should use these APIs rather than accessing the database directly.

## API Controller Structure

Create an `ApiControllers.cs` file in the Controllers folder (or separate controller files if you prefer) with endpoints for:

- GET endpoints to retrieve expense data (all expenses, filtered by status, by employee)
- POST endpoints to create new expenses
- PUT/PATCH endpoints to update expense status (approve, reject)
- DELETE endpoints if the application needs to remove records

## Swagger Documentation

Include Swagger documentation so developers can see all available endpoints and test them interactively through the Swagger UI at `/swagger`. This is invaluable for debugging and API exploration.

## Centralised Data Access

Both the main application pages and the chat interface must interact with the database through these APIs - they should never query the database directly. This keeps the data access layer centralised and maintainable.

The API controllers should call the Services layer, which in turn calls stored procedures. This layered architecture makes the code easier to test and maintain.

See also: prompt-024-sqlcmd-stored-procedures for the stored procedure patterns, prompt-020-model-function-calling for how the chat interface uses these APIs.

Build an ASP.NET Razor Pages application in C# that recreates the functionality shown in the screenshots in the Legacy-Screenshots folder.

## Application Structure

Organise the code following standard ASP.NET conventions:

- **Pages/**: Razor Pages for the user interface (Index.cshtml, AddExpense.cshtml, etc.)
- **Controllers/**: API controllers for data operations
- **Models/**: Data models representing database entities (can use a single ExpenseModels.cs file)
- **Services/**: Business logic and data access through stored procedures
- **wwwroot/**: Static files (CSS, JavaScript)

## User Interface Requirements

The main Index page should provide clear navigation to all the standard database operations like adding records, viewing data, and filtering results. Aim for a clean, modern user interface that's intuitive and responsive.

## Technology Requirements

Target .NET 8 (the current Long Term Support version):

    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>

The application uses a user-assigned managed identity to connect to Azure SQL Database - no connection strings with passwords. See prompt-008-use-existing-db for connection string configuration.

## Data Access

All database operations should go through the Services layer, which calls stored procedures. Never construct SQL queries directly in the application code. See prompt-024-sqlcmd-stored-procedures for the stored procedure patterns.

## Critical: Column Name Alignment

When mapping SQL results to C# model properties, the column names in `reader.GetOrdinal("ColumnName")` must EXACTLY match what the stored procedures return. Check stored-procedures.sql for the actual column aliases:

- The stored procedure returns `AmountDecimal` (not `Amount`) - map this to the model's `Amount` property
- The stored procedure returns `ReviewedByName` (not `ReviewerName`) - map this to the model's `ReviewerName` property

Example of correct mapping:
```csharp
Amount = reader.GetDecimal(reader.GetOrdinal("AmountDecimal")),
ReviewerName = reader.IsDBNull(reader.GetOrdinal("ReviewedByName")) ? null : reader.GetString(reader.GetOrdinal("ReviewedByName")),
```

Getting these names wrong causes "Unable to cast object" or "column not found" runtime errors.

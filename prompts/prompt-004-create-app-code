Build an ASP.NET Razor Pages application in C# that recreates the functionality shown in the screenshots in the Legacy-Screenshots folder.

## Application Structure

Organise the code following standard ASP.NET conventions:

- **Pages/**: Razor Pages for the user interface (Index.cshtml, AddExpense.cshtml, etc.)
- **Controllers/**: API controllers for data operations
- **Models/**: Data models representing database entities
- **Services/**: Business logic and data access through stored procedures
- **wwwroot/**: Static files (CSS, JavaScript)

## User Interface Requirements

The main Index page should provide clear navigation to all the standard database operations like adding records, viewing data, and filtering results. Aim for a clean, modern user interface that's intuitive and responsive.

## Technology Requirements

Target .NET 8 (the current Long Term Support version):

    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>

The application uses a user-assigned managed identity to connect to Azure SQL Database - no connection strings with passwords. See prompt-008-use-existing-db for connection string configuration.

## Data Access

All database operations should go through the Services layer, which calls stored procedures. Never construct SQL queries directly in the application code. See prompt-024-sqlcmd-stored-procedures for the stored procedure patterns.

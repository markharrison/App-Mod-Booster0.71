Create a PowerShell deployment script called deploy.ps1 in the deploy-app folder that automates application code deployment to Azure App Service.

The script should work seamlessly with the infrastructure deployment by reading the deployment context file (.deployment-context.json) created by deploy-infra/deploy.ps1. When this context file exists, the script should not require any parameters.

The script should accept optional parameters for the resource group name and web app name, which override values from the context file if provided. Include switches to skip the build step (for redeployments) and to configure app settings after deployment.

The deployment process should:

1. Check for a .deployment-context.json file - look in BOTH the current directory (./) AND the parent directory (../) since the script may be called from either the repo root (by deploy-all.ps1) or from within the deploy-app folder directly
2. Validate that Azure CLI is installed and the user is logged in
3. Build and publish the .NET application using dotnet publish
4. Create a deployment zip package with the DLL files at the root level (not in a subdirectory)
5. Deploy to Azure App Service using az webapp deploy with the clean and restart flags
6. **Handle deployment warnings gracefully** - az webapp deploy outputs progress messages to stderr (like "Warming up Kudu", "Starting the site") which are normal, not errors
7. Clean up the temporary zip file after deployment
8. Display the application URLs including the /Index page and /swagger endpoint

The zip file structure is critical - Azure App Service expects the DLL files at the root of the zip, not inside a subdirectory like publish/ or app/.

**Critical: Handle az webapp deploy output correctly**

The `az webapp deploy` command outputs progress warnings to stderr which are NORMAL, not errors. The script must capture and parse the actual deployment result rather than just checking exit codes:

```powershell
Write-Host "Deploying to Azure App Service..." -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "(This may take 2-3 minutes...)" -ForegroundColor Yellow

$deployResult = az webapp deploy `
    --resource-group $ResourceGroup `
    --name $WebAppName `
    --src-path $zipFile `
    --type zip `
    --clean true `
    --restart true `
    --output json 2>&1

# Check if deployment succeeded by parsing the result
# az webapp deploy outputs warnings to stderr but still succeeds
if ($deployResult -match '"status":\s*"RuntimeSuccessful"' -or $deployResult -match 'Deployment has completed successfully') {
    Write-Host "Deployment completed successfully!" -ForegroundColor Green
}
elseif ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0) {
    # Even if exit code is non-zero, check if deployment actually succeeded
    if ($deployResult -match 'completed successfully' -or $deployResult -match 'RuntimeSuccessful') {
        Write-Host "✓ Deployment succeeded despite warnings" -ForegroundColor Green
    } else {
        Write-Error "Deployment failed. Check Azure portal for details."
        exit 1
    }
}
```

Do NOT use `--output none 2>$null` as this hides the deployment result and makes it impossible to determine if the deployment actually succeeded.

Path handling is also critical - use `$PSScriptRoot` to build paths relative to the script location, not relative to the current working directory. This ensures the script works correctly whether called from the repo root (by deploy-all.ps1) or from within the deploy-app folder:

```powershell
$scriptDir = $PSScriptRoot
$repoRoot = Split-Path -Parent $scriptDir
$projectPath = Join-Path $repoRoot "src/ExpenseManagement/ExpenseManagement.csproj"
```

When the ConfigureSettings switch is used, the script should configure the connection string and managed identity client ID using values from the deployment context or by querying Azure deployment outputs.

Also create a deploy-app/README.md file documenting both the automated script usage and manual deployment steps. Make it clear that after running deploy-infra/deploy.ps1, users can simply run deploy-app/deploy.ps1 with no parameters.

The application URL to view the main interface is /Index not the root URL - make this clear to users.

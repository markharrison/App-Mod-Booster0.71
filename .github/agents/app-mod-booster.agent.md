# App Mod Booster Agent
When asked to "modernise my app" you must read only the prompt files that are listed in the prompt-order file in the order listed there until you have finished compiling all the work you need to do. 

Then create a plan for the work and detail the plan as check box items in the pull request you create. Also put the name of the prompt file that task relates to in brackets next to each task.

Also include a checkbox for "Completed all work" which you will not check until you have finished working. Then complete all the tasks and finally check the last box.
